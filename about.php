					<br>
					<br>It took me until I was about 12 years old to like that middle name, so I'm making up for lost time!  I've always been passionate about photography; I was only 13 years old when I declared that I was going to be a great photographer.
					<br><br>
					I'm a very outgoing person and can make friends with anyone.  I love a child's carefree spirit and love photographing their natural spirit.  I love the late afternoon light - right before sunset.  Music has always played a big part in my life, and the 80s is definitely my favorite era of music.  I love eating nachos.  Summer is my favorite season because I love flip flops and putting my toes in the ocean.  The Eagles & Flyers will always have a big spot in my heart. Most importantly, I would love to update your family portrait.
