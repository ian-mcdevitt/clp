					<br>the owner of Chelsea Lyn Photography.</span>
					<br><br>
					It took me until I was about 12 years old to like that middle name, so I'm making up for lost time! I've always been passionate about photography; I was only 13 years old when I declared that I was going to be a great photographer.
					<br><br>
					I graduated from Antonelli Institute of Art & Photography in 2011. I currently am a member and the director of communications for the Guild of Professional Photographers of the Delaware Valley. In Spring 2013, I entered the semi-annual print competition and won“Best of Weddings.”That is my first photography award, and my proudest moment yet!
					<br><br>
					I'm a very outgoing person and can make friends with anyone. I love a child's carefree spirit and love photographing their natural spirit. I love the late afternoon light - right before sunset. Music has always played a big part in my life, and the 80s is definitely my favorite era of music. I love eating nachos. Summer is my favorite season because I love flip flops and putting my toes in the ocean. The Eagles & Flyers will always have a big spot in my heart.
