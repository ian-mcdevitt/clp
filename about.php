					Chelsea Lyn began her life in Philadelphia, and instantly grew very fond of the city. She moved away with her family at a young age, and always yearned to return. In September 2009, shortly after her high school graduation, she did just that, to start her photography education. She attends Antonelli Institute of Art and Photography, located just outside of the Philadelphia city limits. In Spring 2011, she will graduate from Antonelli Institute with an Associate in Specialized Technology degree. 
					<br />Chelsea became passionate about photography at a young age and quickly caught on that it was more than just a passion; it was embedded in her genes. At a very young age, Chelsea watched her dad always playing with his film SLR, and always loved being in front of the camera. At 13 years old, she knew that photography was what she wanted to do for the rest of her life. A few years later, Chelsea discovered that on her dad's side of the family, her great-grandfather owned his own darkroom and a studio in downtown Philadelphia.
					<br />Chelsea loves photographing anything and everything, as long as she has her camera, named Roxanne, in her hands. She especially loves to photograph people, and she devotes herself to capturing a person's true beauty and emotion in each and every one of her photos.
