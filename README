# CLPPhotoSite

This software was originally created to run chelsealynphotography.com (hence the CLP). It is a general-purpose photographer's gallery software; using this software (with a bit of database monkeying), you can set up any number of "default" slideshows that are visible to all visitors to your website, as well as client-specific galleries that are accessible only by those who know the specific gallery ID.
