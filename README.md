CLPPhotoSite
------------

This software was originally created to run chelsealynphotography.com (hence the CLP). It is a general-purpose photographer's gallery software; using this software (with a bit of database monkeying), you can set up any number of "default" slideshows that are visible to all visitors to your website, as well as client-specific galleries that are accessible only by those who know the specific gallery ID.

Okay, I lied. This isn't general-purpose. There's a lot of stuff in here that's very specifically built for Chelsea Lyn Photography, but if you really wanted, I'm sure you could figure out how to monkey with it enough to get it working for you! =D
